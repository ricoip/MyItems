*items.ricoip.com was previously known as MyItems. [Learn more about my new repository naming rules.](https://github.com/ricoip/ricoip/blob/ricoip/repo-naming.md)*

When I go on a trip, I print out little stickers that includes my name, a QR code (and link) to this website, and a unique ID for the attached item.

It displays ownership ("hey, that power bank is mine, so you better return it and don't act like it's yours") and also allows people to contact me in case they find my lost items.
